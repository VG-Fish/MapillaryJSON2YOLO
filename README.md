Copy and paste the contents of main.py using your method of choice. 

Change the `directory` variable near the top of the Python file to the path to the directory containing the Mapillary image annotations (which should be JSON files).

Changing the `"data"` in the `os.makedirs()` call will change the directory to where the new annotations.txt files are saved.

All of the distinct classes will be saved to `classes.txt` (you can change this in line 31).
